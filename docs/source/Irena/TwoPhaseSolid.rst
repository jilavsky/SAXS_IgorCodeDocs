Two Phase Solid model
=====================

**This tool generates 3D RANDOM representation (voxelgram) of Two Phase Solid material, current version uses method used in SAXSMorph, I plan to add  similar methods (e.g., Quintanilla cited below) when I can. For details on the science behind it see paper : B. Ingham, et.al., SAXSMorph: a program for generating representative morphologies for two-phase materials from small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering data, J. Appl. Cryst. 44 (2011) 221-224, and J. Quintanilla, Versatility and robustness of Gaussian random ﬁelds for modelling random media, Modelling Simul. Mater. Sci. Eng. 15 (2007) S337–S351, and other papers on this subject**

This model is applicable **ONLY to TWO PHASE SOLID MATERIALS** It is critical users understand its limitations and use this model appropriately. Further, it is critical to understand, that this model represents scattering system in a box with specific (user defined) size with some (user defined) resolution. Practical limit on resolution (size/voxel size) seems to be about 100. This means, that the range of scatterer sizes, which can be measured is probably something like 20-40. This limits the q range which this model can fit to something like 1 to 1.5 decades in q.

This is random "visualization tool" = this tool will generate one of MANY possible shapes of the arrangement of material, which will have same or similar scattering curve. Intensity which the two phase structure should scatter is back calculated.

This is the main screen:

In the top part are :ref:`standard data selection tools <DataSelection>` . Please note, that this tool requires desmeared data, if you are using USAXS data.

This is how the screen looks like with data selected. Button “\ **Graph Data**\ ” loads data into the tool and creates the graph.

*Input some model values* - *Porosity* needs to be known or you can use scattering contrast and calculate Porosity from invariant. Invariant is calculated during extrapolations below. *Box size* is model volume size in Angstroms. For now this is cube, future versions will be able to have sides with different sizes. Select *Box divisions* - this is resolution you plan to use. 50 is reasonably fast on my machine, 100 is slow. Above 100 you probably run out of memory and patience.

*Next step is to extrapolate data to Q=0 and Q=inf.* this is done by selecting q range at low end of data you want to model with cursors and using button “\ **Extrapolate low-Q**\ ”. Then select range of data at high q (data should follow Porod's law, power law should be -4). Using button “\ **Extrapolate high-Q**\ ” extrapolate data to high q values (Q=50). Note, that the Invariant is calculated.

Now, back to size of the Box. In order to model properly the data you selected, you need to have size of the box larger than size related to q\ :sub:`min`. These sizes are actually calculated on the second Tab - “\ **2. Advanced Pars**\ ”. In my case, the R\ :sub:`max` on that Tab is 31200A, which means I need may be 50000A box size.

Push Button “\ **Calculate Params**\ ” which will calculate extrapolated intensity and other internal parameters.

*This MAY BE SLOW* Push Button “\ **Generate 3D Model**\ ” which will generate the 3D Model and append intensity calculated from this model to the graph:

As you can see, the fit is good at low-q (in extrapolation to q=0) and for about 1 decade in Q. With resolution of 100 that is probably the best one can expect.

*This MAY BE SLOW* Push Button “\ **Display 3D Model**\ ” which will display the 3D Model in Gizmo.
