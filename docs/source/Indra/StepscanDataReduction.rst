Reduce step scanned data procedure
==================================

When you collect step scan USAXS data on USAXS instrument, your data are saved inside spec file. Spec file is where instrument makes various records, including the recorded data for step scans. The file name is created by adding MM_DD_ (month_day_) to the name staff provides, typically to user name. When you collect SAXS data, a folder with the same name with appended "_saxs" is created and for  WAXS with "_waxs".

After you reduce data from USAXS instrument, you will have in your Igor experiment data arranged in data folders also - in this case you will have USAXS data in root\:USAXS\:Samplename.
To see inside of the current Igor experiment, use DataBrowser (ctrl-B or cmd-B).
